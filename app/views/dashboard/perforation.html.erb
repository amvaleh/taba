			<p>Cased-hole logging is frequently performed to help operators obtain additional information from the formation and to evaluate the completion of the well. BGES is well experienced in a wide range of wireline services, including specialty logs for evaluation casing integrity and formation evaluation, downhole pressure/temperature data acquisition, conventional production logging, and common mechanical services such as perforating and plug setting. To ensure that the desired depth is reached in wells of different orientations, multiple conveyance methods are available, depending on the customerâ€™s application.</p>
<p>BGES has extensive experience in cased-hole log analysis and interpretation. Our technical team understands that important decisions affecting wellsite operations must often be made promptly.
